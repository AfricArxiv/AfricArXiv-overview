## AfricArXiv website translations

The AfricArXiv website is auto-translated by GTranslate.io via a  wp plugin from English into 19 languages spoken on the continent.

Currently we provide our content in the following languages:

--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
French | German | Hausa | Hindi | Igbo 
Malagasy| Portuguese | Sesotho |Somali |Sunda

The translation is good but not perfect which is why…: **We are looking for volunteers to help us improve the translated texts on our website.**
