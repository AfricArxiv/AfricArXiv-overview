# PKP Open Preprint System

*PKP is a multi-university initiative developing (free) open source software and conducting research to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing.*

In September 2018, [PKP and SciELO Announced the Development of an Open Source Preprint Server System](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2018/09/22/pkp-and-scielo-announce-development-of-open-source-preprint-server-system/).

The Open Preprint System *OPS V3.2 beta* will be launched on Feb 28, 2020. Read [The Road to Preprints (Part 1): Introducing Open Preprint Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2020/02/24/the-road-to-preprints-part-1-introducing-open-preprint-systems/)


# Installation 
Installation should be easy and straightforward, all we need is a server for hosting and a contact person for maintenance and and ensurance of regular updates of the OPS package, whenever PKP releases an update.

The [PKP Web Application Library](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib) (PKP-WAL on GitHub) contains all code and descriptions fro OMS, OJS and OPS a.o.
We collect any challenges and suggestions for changes with the software [here as Issues](https://github.com/AfricArxiv/preprint-repository/issues) first try and solve within the AfricArXiv community before approaching PKP. 


## Translations
**Submissions**
PKP OPS supports several languages. Default is English with oppotunities to add translations of titles, keywords and other metadata in sevrral other languages.

**Interface**
The PKP OPS interface is released with and English, Portuguese and Spanish interface.
Translations to other langauges are aprtially underway and we will mobilize our community to add African translations.

**community effort**
The PKP translation toolset [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) is announced and described at https://pkp.sfu.ca/2020/01/22/introducing-weblate-a-new-path-for-ojs-omp-translations/
Anyone is welcome to work on translations, including starting new ones that will be collected and included with the next releases of the software.
We call on the AfricArXiv community for volunteer translations into African languages; e-mail us to contribute@africarxiv.org 


## OJS Usage in Africa: 
Usage statistics are difficult to obtain - no requirement of any kind of registration. 
[This map](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ojs-usage/ojs-map/) attempts to capture journal counts per country over time. Many more might not be captured but instead to be found anecdotally by looking around Africa. 
The South African numbers are extremely high because that's where [AJOL](ajol.info/) is hosted.
