# PKP Open Preprint System


Translations: The PKP translation toolset is announced and described here: https://pkp.sfu.ca/2020/01/22/introducing-weblate-a-new-path-for-ojs-omp-translations/
Anyone is welcome to work on translations, including starting new ones that will be collected and included with the next releases of the software.

## Usage in Africa: 
Usage statistics are difficult to obtain - no requirement of any kind of registration. 
This map attempts to capture journal counts per country. Many more might not be captured and to be found anecdotally by looking around Africa. 
The South African numbers are extremely high because that's where AJOL is hosted. https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ojs-usage/ojs-map/
